# This repository contains a custom Pantheon Upstream used to create and manage
# every site on the YaleSites platform. Out of the box this project is not
# connected to any individual Drupal site. Setting a Pantheon site name and UUID
# allows lando to connect the local dev environment to a Pantheon environment.

# Copy and rename this file to .lando.local.yml and set any site specific
# variables and overrides. The default values in this file will connect to the
# YaleSite's integration environment.

# Set a local name for this application; this can be any value.
