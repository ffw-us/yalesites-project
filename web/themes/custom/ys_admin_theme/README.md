## Developing this theme

Do not edit the files in the `css` directory. Any changes will be overwritten next time a build is run.

Instead, run the develop script (`npm run develop`) and edit files in the `scss` directory. The css will be compiled automatically.

If you add a new scss file, you will also need to add it to a library, and have it attached somewhere before its styles will be used by the theme.
